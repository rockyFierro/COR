“What I Learned at Lambda School” Publication

Publishing regular and relevant content is a signal to potential employers that you are dedicated to and immersed in the tech 
world. These blog posts are an exercise in reflection as well as additional content to attract employers. Your intended 
audience are hiring managers at companies to which you are applying. Think hard and compose blog posts that will present you - 
and Lambda School - well. These blog posts will build a reservoir of content that illustrate your competence.



For Week One, we want to know how you overcame struggles while studying at Lambda School. How have you grown personally? 
Professionally?



Walk us through your experience at Lambda. What trials did you come up against, and how did you overcome them? What helped you 
most to stay consistent in showing up every day and doing your best? This is not your resume. This is about the intangible 
accomplishments and lessons that make you unique and even more attractive as a potential hire.

## 2.  Next Week II

[labs to contribute to](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs)

“How I Contributed to a Code Base That Was New to Me” Publication
One task you’ll almost certainly encounter on your first day at your first developer job is being handed a code base that is 
new and unfamiliar to you, and an assignment to work on it in some way. Working with legacy code is an everyday task for a 
professional developer, but is something that will most likely be new to you. This week, you’re going to practice this skill 
and write a blog post describing your process and results.

*Learn to practice interviewing*

*Technical interview sessions (Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays).*

*Behavioral interview sessions (Tuesdays and Thursdays).*

*Learn to write code and get a green score in your GitHub contributions graph*

*Learn to sign up to https://app.huntr.co/lambda-school/signup and track your job applications*

## 3.  Next Week III

learn a new language, tool, or framework

During your time at Lambda School, you have had the opportunity to learn many things that were new to you. We’ve guided you 
through several programming languages, frameworks, and tools that are used by professional developers all over the world. At 
some point in your career, possibly even at your first job, you’ll want or need to learn something new. That will be your task 
this week. Pick up a new language, tool, or framework, and use it to build a functioning Web Application.

## 4.  Next Week IV

Contribute to an Open Source Project

The connected world is powered by open source software. From Linux to React, it is hard to imagine going an entire day in 2018 
without touching a piece of open source software. While many companies sponsor the development of open source tools, the vast 
majority of open source work is contributed by volunteers. Getting involved in the open source community is a great way to 
give back, to learn new things, collaborate with a diverse and distributed team, and to enhance your skills as a software 
developer. Hiring managers view open source contributions as very strong positive signals and having this kind of work in your 
portfolio will help you get more meetings.

At the end of this module, you should be able to:

write a blog post or record a YouTube video then publish on "how I contributed to my first open source project"

## 5.  Next Week V

This week your goals are the following: -Publishing an open-source tool -Write a blog post or create a YouTube video about 
your experience. “I Published My First Open Source Tool” or similar topic.

## 6.  Next Week VI

This week your goals are the following: -How to plan a project -Write a blog post or create a YouTube video about your 
experience. “How I Took a Set of Business Requirements, Planned a Project, and Turned it Into Code” or similar topic.

### OOP

Specific words you should be comfortable using by the end of this objective:

- [ ] Class

- [ ] Object

- [ ] Instance

- [ ] Constructor

- [ ] Type

- [ ] Inheritance

- [ ] Superclass

- [ ] Subclass

- [ ] Field

- [ ] Composition

- [ ] Method (and Class versus Instance method)

- [ ] Variable (and Class versus Instance variable)

- [ ] Private versus Public (Methods and Variables)

- [ ] Abstract (referring to Class or Method)

- [ ] Interface

- [ ] Encapsulation

- [ ] Getters and Setters

- [ ] Polymorphism

- [ ] Dynamic dispatch

- [ ] Overriding

- [ ] Overloading

- [ ] Message passing

Other concepts less specific to OOP but still relevant:

- [ ] Namespace

- [ ] Scope

- [ ] Global

- [ ] Closure

- [ ] Mutable versus Immutable

- [ ] Separation of Concerns

Important note - this lesson, and all Python/Django material, will be focused on class-based inheritance as a basis of OOP. There is another form of inheritance - prototype-based - and you’ve actually already been using it with JavaScript. This will be revisted more explicitly when we get back to front-end material (with Django you can still use React for your front-end).

Another Python caveat - in dynamic languages like Python, it is typical that many of these concepts are “standards” but the 
language does not actually enforce them as in Java. With Python, you can dig deep into the inners of the language and “monkey-patch” (change code while it is running) to your hearts content - with this power comes great foot-shooting ability, so don’t do it unless you understand the situation and know that you need to do something drastic to achieve your goal.

Overview

Live-code a basic Python class that represents a Character in an RPG. Describe using the terms above, and make sure at least some of the fields are private, some fields have getters/setters (which enforce some sort of logic/check), and some methods are abstract (to be implemented by subclasses).

- [ ] Follow Along

Write four subclasses of Character - Warrior, Mage, Cleric, and Rogue.

- [ ] Challenge

Come up with and implement your own “specialist” class that is a subclass of one of the four classes we implemented together.
Present your class to a teammate, using appropriate OOP terminology (and have them present theirs to you).
